## üìù Introduction
The IMDB Dataset Analysis Project explores the top 1000 movies and TV shows listed on IMDB. Through this analysis, we aim to uncover trends and insights related to movies' ratings, box office performances, genres, and other key variables.

## üìä Dataset Overview
**Dataset Name**: IMDB Movies Dataset  
**Description**: This dataset consists of information about the top 1000 movies and TV shows, containing 16 attributes with 1000 rows each.  
**Data Source**: [IMDB Dataset]([https://www.imdb.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshitshankhdhar/imdb-dataset-of-top-1000-movies-and-tv-shows))

### Dataset Variables
- **Poster_Link**: URL of the movie poster.
- **Series_Title**: Title of the movie.
- **Released_Year**: Year when the movie was released.
- **Certificate**: Certification earned by the movie.
- **Runtime**: Duration of the movie.

## üß© Design Process
The design process is iterative and involves visualizing the data to find the most effective representation of each analysis. We used a variety of charts and dashboards in Tableau to display our findings:

1. **Income vs. Genre Analysis**  
   - Initial Visualization: Histogram  
   - Final Visualization: Line Chart

2. **Distribution of Movies by Release Year**  
   - Initial Visualization: Simple Text  
   - Final Visualization: Pie Chart

3. **Certificates Comparison**  
   - Initial Visualization: Side-by-side Bar Chart  
   - Final Visualization: Stacked Bar Chart

## üé® Dashboard Rationale
### 1. IMDB Release Year Analysis
We grouped release years into intervals of 20 years and compared attributes such as gross income, genre, and number of movies released. The color scheme follows a color-blind friendly palette, ensuring accessibility.

### 2. IMDB Directors Analysis
We analyzed directors' performances in terms of IMDB ratings, box office collections, and movie certifications. Using word clouds and stacked bar charts, we highlighted key patterns and correlations.

### 3. IMDB Actor Analysis
Director-actor pairs were analyzed to identify which pairs produced the most movies together and achieved the highest box office earnings.

### 4. IMDB Rating Analysis
We explored how IMDB ratings correlate with runtime, certification, and the number of votes. The results help determine factors contributing to higher ratings.

### 5. IMDB Metascore Analysis
Metascores were compared with gross earnings, votes, and certificates to uncover patterns and influences.

### 6. IMDB Number of Votes Analysis
We examined how the length of movie overviews relates to the number of votes a movie receives. Python was used for word count analysis.

## üîç Observations and Insights
