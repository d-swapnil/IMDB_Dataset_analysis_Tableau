        <b style="font-size:20px"><u>Introduction to IMDB Dataset</u></b><br><br>

        <p>Dataset name - IMDB Movies Dataset<br>Dataset Description - This is an IMDB dataset of top 1000 movies and TV shows. The dataset has, 1000 rows and 16 columns 
        </p>

        <p>The variables of the dataset are as follows - 
            <br>a) Poster_Link - Link of the poster that imdb using 
            <br>b) Series_Title = Name of the movie 
            <br>c) Released_Year - Year at which that movie released 
            <br>d) Certificate - Certificate earned by that movie 
            <br>e) Runtime - Total runtime of the movie
            <br>f) Genre - Genre of the movie 
            <br>g) IMDB_Rating - Rating of the movie at IMDB site 
            <br>h) Overview - mini story/ summary

            </p><br>

        <b style="font-size:20px"><u>Design Process</u></b><br><br>

        <img src="images/image_1.jpg" alt="image1" width="700" height="500"><br><br>

        <p>So, above are two examples, for which we provided an initial and final design. In example 1, finding a relation between income (continuous variable) and genre (categorical variable) was the task. We first decided on a Histogram, but a Line chart instead made more sense plotting. The direct value of income is visible against each genre. Similarly, the questions related to finding top or bottom values against an attribute, Pie chart was the initial choice. But, Word cloud is a much better option. It highlights all the values based on size rather than hovering over.
        </p><br>

        <img src="images/image_2.jpg" alt="image2" width="700" height="500"><br><br>

        <p>In the above diagram, eg 3, first the distribution of movies wrt release year, we decided on simple text format first. But this is too simple a visualization. Pie chart gave a better visualization for this question. Similarly, in eg 4, when we have multiple categorical values, certificates in this example, side by side bar chart does not provide good visuals. Rather a stacked bar chart is preferred as we can see the comparison.  
        </p><br>

        <b style="font-size:20px"><u>Rationale of my design choices</u></b> <br><br>

        <p><b>1. IMDB Release Year Analysis</b></p>

        <p>For this analysis, I first considered creating 4 visualizations. The release year was compared with gross income, directors, genre and number of movies. For this, the release years, which ranges from 1920 to 2020, are divided into 5 groups. The size of these bins are 20 years each. The “Group” feature of TABLEAU was used for this. The colors used for all the four plots are simple blue in color. Also, I have used the Color blind theme option available in TABLEAU color tab. We use bar charts, line charts and pie charts here. All the 4 visualizations were then displayed into a single dashboard. The background is subtle in color, so that the plots inside are visible. The dashboard title and chart titles are black in color with size 10, which are proportionate to the plots.</p><br>

        <p><b>2. IMDB Directors Analysis</b></p>

        <p>For analyzing director attributes, I have taken the analysis with IMDB rating, box office collection and type of certificate of movies. This plot is a bit more colorful than the previous one. But all the colors are suitable for colorblind people to view as well. Here the background color of the plots are kept white, as it makes the plot colors more attractive. Here, we make use of word cloud, stacked bar charts. The plots are combined in a Dashboard, and the color chosen is gray, which highlights the entire  Dashboard. The color combinations used for each plot helps to visualize the data very well.
        </p><br>

        <p><b>3. IMDB Actor Analysis</b></p>

        <p>The actor's analysis was an interesting one. There are 4 columns for this, and these are combined and using python, we create director-actor pairs. This helped understanding which director and actor pair have created most movies together. Total 3 graphs are made on this data attribute, by comparing director with stars, number of votes and box office income. Here we used packed bubbles, text  charts and line charts for visualization.  The colors for the plots are simple and light. The dashboard color is mild. Also, the font size and color is suitable for the charts. 
        </p><br>

        <p><b>4. IMDB Rating Analysis</b></p>

        <p>The IMDB rating is a very important parameter to make a movie recommendation. The rating ranges from 7.6 and above in this dataset. There are 4 questions answered here, comparing rating with box office collection, certificate, runtime in mins and no of votes. For all these plots, the charts such as bar chart, line chart and bubble chart are considered. Blue color is prominently used across, as this provides good visualization. The background of the Dashboard is light colored too, with good font size and color.</p><br>

        <p><b>5. IMDB Metascore</b></p>

        <p>The IMDB Metascore is the score earned by the movies. This attribute is compared with gross income, no of votes, movies produced and certificates. As you can see in the plots, there are word clouds, bar chart and line chart are used. The colors used are fresh and bright and are visible to color blind people too. This is taken from the color blind color options available on TABLEAU. The dashboard color is light and highlights the plots well. The font size and color and clearly visible .
        </p><br>

        <p><b>6. IMDB Number of votes</b></p>

        <p>The final dashboard is made with two plots that compare the number of votes with overview of movies attribute and genre. This plot is very interesting as the overview of the movies is a very long string for each movie. The number of words are counted for each overview using PYTHON, and these are then compared in relation with the number of votes. I have used bar charts and line charts for this. The colors used are perfect and highlight the visualization well. The dashboard is light shaded and the title for questions is appropriate and visible well.</p><br>
